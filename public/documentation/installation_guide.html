<h1>Chamilo 2 installation guide</h1>
  <p>
      This is the official Chamilo installation guide for version 2+.
  </p>
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
This version of Chamilo requires the following software stack.
  It might be installed in other contexts as PHP is very portable, but the following has been thoroughly tested for production environments.
  <ul>
      <li>Apache 2.4+ (with mod-rewrite enabled)</li>
      <li>MariaDB 10+ or MySQL 5+</li>
      <li>PHP 8.2+</li>
      <li>Optional: A local Redis server</li>
  </ul>
  Within PHP, Chamilo requires or benefits from the following modules, which might already be included in PHP on your system:<br/>
  <ul>
      <li>bcmath</li>
      <li>curl</li>
      <li>exif</li>
      <li>gd</li>
      <li>iconv</li>
      <li>intl</li>
      <li>json</li>
      <li>mbstring</li>
      <li>mysql</li>
      <li>opcache</li>
      <li>pcre</li>
      <li>session (php-session, usually shipped with PHP)</li>
      <li>soap</li>
      <li>sodium</li>
      <li>xml</li>
      <li>zip</li>
      <li>zlib</li>
      <li>ldap (optional, but mandatory in dev env)</li>
      <li>redis (optional)</li>
      <li>xapian (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Web-panel installation</h2>
    <h3>Database</h3>
      Make sure you have a database available with full permissions.<br>
      Do not share that database with another application as Chamilo might need to create
      a table that has the same name as a table in the other application.
    <h3>Virtual host</h3>
      Define a new virtual host/subdomain name you will use for Chamilo (Chamilo 2 does *not* work as a sub-folder of an existing website, you need a subdomain like "elearning.yourdomain.com").<br>
      Upload and/or unzip your Chamilo files inside your web folder (usually inside a folder called "public_html/").<br>
      Configure a virtual host pointing at the "public" directory inside your Chamilo directory. For example, this could be "/home/elearning.yourdomain.com/public_html/chamilo2/public/".<br>
    <h3>Files permissions</h3>
      Make sure the following files and folders are writeable by the web server. Set permissions to 0770 for example:
      <ul>
        <li>var/</li>
        <li>.env</li>
      </ul>
      The .env is the *file* where Chamilo will write the data collected during the installation.<br>
      You can create an empty file called ".env" at the root of your Chamilo folder
      ("/home/elearning.yourdomain.com/public_html/chamilo2/.env" in the example above),
      or temporarily give write permissions to the web server on the entire Chamilo folder
      ("/home/elearning.yourdomain.com/public_html/chamilo2/"). If you do the whole folder,
      don't forget to write down the permissions it had initially, and return it to its original
      permissions when the installation is over.
    <h3>PHP settings</h3>
      Some PHP settings are recommended, but the default values should be enough to get you started.<br>
      If you prefer to set them previously, here are the settings to change:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://php.net/manual/ref.errorfunc.php#ini.display-errors">display_errors</a> off</li>
        <li><a href="https://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.file-uploads">file_uploads</a> on</li>
        <li><a href="https://php.net/manual/ref.session.php#ini.session.auto-start">session.auto_start</a> off</li>
        <li><a href="https://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.short-open-tag">short_open_tag</a> off</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.cookie-httponly">session.cookie_httponly</a> on</li>
        <li><a href="https://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.upload-max-filesize">upload_max_filesize</a> >100M</li>
        <li><a href="https://php.net/manual/ini.core.php#ini.post-max-size">post_max_size</a> >100M</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.memory-limit">memory_limit</a> >128M</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Installation wizard</h3>
      You are ready to go. Open your browser on your subdomain (elearning.yourdomain.com in the example above), keep your database credentials at hand, and let the Chamilo installer guide you.

    <h3>Sessions and Redis</h3>
      In this beta version, there are known issues with sessions not getting updated fast enough, which can be solved (temporarily) by using a Redis server. Check the command line instructions for more about this. This is a temporary situation that we expect to fix before the stable release.

  <h2>Command line installation</h2>

  <h3>Software stack</h3>

<p>Assuming you are using a dedicated Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, these commands should help you have the software stack installed in a breeze. Otherwise, please review the requirements above and make sure they are met before moving on to the next section.</p>
<pre>
sudo -s
apt update && apt -y upgrade
apt -y install apache2 libapache2-mod-php8.3 mariadb-client mariadb-server redis-server php8.3-{bcmath,curl,exif,gd,iconv,intl,mbstring,mysql,opcache,soap,xml,zip,redis}
a2enmod rewrite
cd /var/www/
mkdir chamilo
wget https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/releases/download/v2.0.0-beta.1/chamilo2.0.0-beta.1.tar.gz
# about 400MB
tar zxf chamilo2.0.0-beta.1.tar.gz
rm chamilo2.0.0-beta.1.tar.gz
cd chamilo
touch .env
chown -R www-data: var .env
mysql -u root -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON chamilo.* TO chamilo@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '[choose a password here]'";
mysql -u root -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"
mysql_secure_installation
# give a MariaDB root password twice and answer the default "Y" to anything else. The root password is *not* the one you gave above here.
</pre>

  <h3>Database</h3>

<p>You will need a database user with privilege to fully use (and optionally create) a database.<br>
Although progress has been made to support multiple database management systems, Chamilo
currently only supports MariaDB and MySQL.<br>
Setup a new user in your database system either through visual tools or directly in the terminal. If you have followed the command lines above, you can skip this.<br>
</p>
  <pre>
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON [db-name].* TO [db-user]@[db-host] IDENTIFIED BY '[db-password]';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql> exit;</pre>
where:
<ul>
    <li>[db-name] is the name of your database</li>
    <li>[db-user] is the user that will have permissions to access this database</li>
    <li>[db-host] is the name of the database server (use <em>localhost</em> when using the same machine for web server and database server - if you use a hosted service, your hosting provider will usually give you this name somewhere)</li>
    <li>[db-password] is the password this user will use to connect to this database on this host. Use common sense to not make it too easy to guess (use special characters, lowercase and uppercase, numbers, and a length of *at least* 8 characters)</li>
</ul>
  <h3>Web server</h3>
Chamilo 2+ only requires a working web server setup to work. You can run it on localhost with the default installation of any web server, provided you configure your DocumentRoot as the path pointing to Chamilo's <em>public/</em> subfolder.<br>
Here is an example Apache vhost configuration file for an installation on the http://my.chamilo.local/ URL (replace all values between brackets, including the brackets, to your custom values).<br>
It includes PHP settings which will only affect this vhost. If you prefer to set those PHP settings in php.ini, you are welcome to do so.<br>
We also assume you will be using a default Redis installation to manage sessions (see notes in the web panel install section).<br>
  <pre>
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
vim [my.chamilo.local].conf
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin [your-email]
    ServerName [my.chamilo.local]
    DocumentRoot [/var/www/chamilo]/public/
    # The following might not even be required
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/[my.chamilo.local]-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/[my.chamilo.local]-access.log combined
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    &lt;Directory [/var/www/chamilo/public]&gt;
      AllowOverride all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    php_value display_errors Off
    php_value file_uploads On
    php_value session.auto_start Off
    php_value short_open_tag Off
    php_value session.cookie_httponly On
    php_value upload_max_filesize 100M
    php_value post_max_size 100M
    php_value memory_limit 128M
    php_value session.save_handler "redis"
    php_value session.save_path "tcp://127.0.0.1:6379"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>
After setting up this virtual host, don't forget to enable it (example here on Debian/Ubuntu's command line):
  <pre>
a2ensite [my.chamilo.local]
systemctl restart apache2</pre>
    <h3>Files permissions</h3>
    Make sure the following files and folders are writeable by the web server. Set permissions to 0770 for example:
    <ul>
        <li>var/</li>
        <li>.env</li>
    </ul>
    Assuming your web server user is <em>www-data</em>, you can do that quickly with the following from inside the Chamilo root directory (already done in first example commands list for Ubuntu):
    <pre>
sudo touch .env
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data var/ .env</pre>
    <h3>PHP settings</h3>
    Some PHP settings are recommended, but the default values should be enough to get you started.<br>
    See vhost config's "php_value" section above for details.

  <h3>Installation wizard</h3>
  You should now be able to direct your browser to your URL (e.g. <em>[http://my.chamilo.local]</em>).<br>
  Chamilo will pick it up from there and offer the installation wizard to help guide you through the rest of the process.

  <h2>Web panel upgrade from 1.11.*</h2>

  <h2>Command line upgrade from 1.11.*</h2>
    <h3>Database</h3>
    Before you start, it is *critical* to delete the <em>version</em> table from your Chamilo 1.11.* database.
    Failure to do this will make the command line upgrade fail immediately after starting.
    The <em>version</em> table is not necessary for Chamilo 1.11.* to work, so don't leave it there.

    <h3>Files</h3>
      The files from Chamilo 1.11.* will be used as source but they will be copied and rearranged
      in the new Chamilo 2 installation, so you will have to indicate a source for the files to the (web or CLI) installer.<br>
      Note the extra pages created in 1.11.x and stored under app/home/ are *not* migrated. They will need to be created again in Chamilo 2 using the "pages" feature.

    <h3>PHP settings</h3>
      Make sure no setting is in the way of a command line upgrade.
      Limits such as memory_limit or max_execution_time should be
      vastly increased for the time of the upgrade.

    <h3>Execution</h3>
      // To be completed

  <h2>Installing on Windows</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    Although Chamilo does work on Windows, it is not officially supported due to the fact that
    we have limited testing capabilities for this operating system. The following instructions have been
    tested on a Windows 11 (desktop) machine with the WAMP application.
    We do not recommend using Windows for production environments.

    <h3>Installation for validation or production</h3>

      <h4>WampServer</h4>
        <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/">Download</a> and install WampServer (accept default options if in doubt).<br>
        Restart WampServer to make these changes effective.<br>
        Open http://localhost/ in your browser. If the WampServer welcome screen with server configuration info appears, it means WampServer is working.<br>
        Click on the WampServer icon in your status bar and go to PHP -&gt; Extensions. Make sure all the following extensions are enabled: php_curl, php_gd, php_intl, php_mbstring, php_mysqli, php_soap, php_xml, php_zip<br>
        Edit C:\wamp64\bin\php\php8.3\php.ini, locate ";extension=sodium" and remove the ";" from the beginning of the line.<br>
        Also, update the "memory_limit" setting from "128M" to "2048M".<br>
<pre>
    memory_limit = 2048M
    #...
    extension=sodium
</pre>
        Save and restart WampServer.<br></br>

        Note: If you use your Windows machine for development, you might
        get errors related to VisualC++. The error itself will point to
        wampserver.aviatechno.net, which seem to be a valid source to download a VisualC++ patch.
        We do not take responsibility about software from other sources. Do your own research.

      <h4>Database</h4>
        Click on the WampServer icon in the status bar (bottom right) and select PhpMyAdmin.<br>
        Choose the MariaDB service and connect to the root user. Enter the root password you set during WampServer installation (probably still empty).<br></br>
        In the "Databases" tab, prepare a new database with the name "chamilo2".<br></br>
        For encoding, choose "utf8mb4_general_ci".<br>
        We recommend setting a proper user and password for that specific database,
        but the root account should also be secured with a different password
        if you plan to expose this to the internet.<br>
        Click "Create".<br>

      <h4>Chamilo</h4>
        Download the latest install-ready package available for version 2
        from <a href="https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/releases">https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms/releases</a>.<br>
        Unzip the package in C:\wamp64\www\chamilo2.<br>
        Create a ".env" file at the root of the chamilo2 folder (C:\wamp64\www\chamilo2\.env).<br>
        If this is not a stable version package, edit the ".env.dist" file and set APP_ENV to "prod".<br>

      <h4>Apache</h4>
        Open the Apache configuration file at C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.*\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf.<br>
        Modify the contents of the file to something like this:<br>
<pre>
  &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  DocumentRoot "C:/wamp64/www/chamilo2/public"
  ServerName chamilo2.local
  &lt;Directory "C:/wamp64/www/chamilo2/public"&gt;
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

      <h4>Installation wizard</h4>
        Open your browser on <a href="http://chamilo.local/">http://chamilo2.local</a>. The installation wizard should appear.<br>
        Follow the instructions to complete the installation.<br>

        Note that it is difficult to change URLs later, so if you plan
        to publish this service online,
        make sure you have properly configured your domain name first.


    <h3>Installation for developers</h3>
      If you want to *develop* Chamilo, you will need still need to install
      WampServer as detailed above, but you will also need a few additional
      components to be able to prepare the package from Git.

      <h4>WampServer</h4>
        See above.

      <h4>Composer</h4>
        <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/">Download</a> and install
        Composer (accept default options if in doubt).<br>
        If the installation is correct, you should be able to run
        "composer -V" in a command prompt (PowerShell or CMD) and see the
        version of Composer appear (probably 2.x).

      <h4>Node.js</h4>
        To install Node.js, you can use the official installer from
        <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>
        using the .msi package.<br>
        Follow the default installation options (Next, Next, Install).<br>
        Once the installation is complete, you can run "node -v" in a
        command prompt (PowerShell or CMD) and see the version of Node.js
        appear (probably 16.x).<br>
        Then we need to install Yarn. In a command prompt *as administrator*,
        run "corepack enable".<br>
        Check the installation with "yarn --version", then
        run "corepack prepare yarn@stable --activate".<br>

      <h4>Database</h4>
        See above.

      <h4>Chamilo</h4>
        In a PowerShell or CMD:<br>
<pre>
    cd C:\wamp64\www
    git clone -b master --depth 1 https://github.com/chamilo/chamilo-lms.git chamilo2
    cd chamilo2
    composer install
    yarn up
    yarn install
    yarn dev
</pre>
        Create a ".env" file at the root of the chamilo2 folder
        (C:\wamp64\www\chamilo2\.env).<br>

      <h4>Apache</h4>
        See above.

      <h4>Installation wizard</h4>
        Open your browser on <a href="http://chamilo.local/">http://chamilo2.local</a>. The installation wizard should appear.<br>
        Follow the instructions to complete the installation.<br>

        Note that it is difficult to change URLs later, so if you plan to publish this service online, make sure you have properly configured your domain name first.

    <h3>Redis</h3>
      For better performance in the highly dynamic interfaces of Chamilo, you might
      want to install the PHP Redis extension from the official PHP website, for example (adapt PHP and Redis version numbers)
      https://downloads.php.net/~windows/pecl/releases/redis/6.*.*/php_redis-6.*.*-8.3-ts-vs16-x64.zip

      This is not necessary to install Chamilo (so you can do it afterwards).

      Download, unzip and place the .dll file into C:\wamp64\bin\php\php8.3.*\ext\
      then add "extension=php_redis.dll" at the end of C:\wamp64\bin\php\php8.3.*\php.ini
      and restart the WampServer and finally select the extension in PHP -&gt; Extensions again).

      You will also need to have a Redis server running. This is tricky because there is no native implementation
      of Redis for Windows, so you have several choices but none is easy. The way we did it is to setup an Ubuntu virtual
      machine using HVM (Hyper-V Virtual Machine Manager) and install Redis on it.

      Once you spawned an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS virtual machine, you can issue those
      simple commands (we use 192.168.1.100 as the IP address of the virtual
      machine, make sure you update that depending on the effective IP address
      your VM is assigned):
<pre>
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install redis-server
    sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf
    # add "bind 192.168.1.100" at the end of the file and comment the "bind 127.0.0.1 -::1" line if you see it uncommented.
    sudo systemctl restart redis-server
</pre>

      Inside your WampServer configuration, in the httpd-vhosts.conf file,
      add the following lines *inside* the &lt;VirtualHost&gt; tag:
<pre>
    php_admin_value session.save_handler "redis"
    php_admin_value session.save_path "tcp://192.168.1.100:6379"
</pre>

      Restart the WampServer and you should be able to access Chamilo.
